Data containers
===============

This directory contains data-only containers, that are shared between services.

The concept is described in the
`Docker user guide <http://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#creating-and-mounting-a-data-volume-container>`_

So far, we have containers for

  - git repositories (repositories)
  - private python distributation packages
