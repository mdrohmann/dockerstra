+If the unit directory has a command ``unit/update``, it should execute a script
+to create a temporary container.  As the last order in this list, you can
+specify a command called ``tests`` on the virtual container ``host``, with an
+argument list called ``tests`` as well.  This list comprises command line
+arguments for test runs, that will be executed in this step.  This way, the
+``unit/update`` command is only considered successful if all the tests work
+after updating the image.  This way, you can make sure, that the tag ``latest``
+is only applied if the update worked.
+
+For every ``unit/update`` command, |project| automatically generates a
+``unit/upgrade`` command, that re-creates and re-starts all running containers
+that depend on the updated image.
